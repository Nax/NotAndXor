For over two years now, I have been wanting to make a combo randomizer, in the like of [SMZ3](https://samus.link), but for Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. I started working on it seriously since a few weeks now, up to the point where it's starting to be playable. This is the first post of a series about the development of this project.

In this part, I am not going to cover the actual project, but rather explain the basics of the Nintendo 64 and the two zelda games on that platform.

## The Nintendo 64

The Nintendo 64 is a rather odd system. It main CPU is a slightly modified [VR4300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R4200), running the MIPS III ISA<note>
Very few games actually took advantage of the 64 bit nature of the system.
